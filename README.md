>I am a Full-Stack Software Developer that leads with curiosity, passion, drive and a healthy amount of play. My background in the arts has primed my tech career with empathy  and a love for dynamic collaboration. As a queer woman of color, I value diversity of thought, technology and humans; and I love the daily challenge of navigating how that diversity coexists. I am brave in my contributions, have a thirst for learning new tech and embrace failure. I value spending my time away from the computer mentoring those pursuing tech and speaking at meet ups.
